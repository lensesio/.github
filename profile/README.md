Lenses is a developer experience for streaming data operations, enabling developers to self-serve and operate any Apache Kafka instance, reducing the cost and complexity of building real-time data pipelines and applications.

Lenses core components are:

* SQL Engine to query data and create streaming apps leveraging Kafka Streams
* App Engine to manage seamless deployments of SQL apps (deployed to Kubernetes)
* Metadata Engine to create a real-time Data Catalog for cross-system datasets and apps
* Connectors to source and sink data
* Monitoring and alerting on infrastructure and data
