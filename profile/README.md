Lenses is the developer tooling that acts as a flexible, intelligent operating layer over any streaming technologies a business chooses (using the Apache Kafka API). This gives engineers one screen to work with all their data streams. 

Core components: 

* Multi-Kafka Identity & Access Management: Unify data access and permissions globally
* Global SQL Studio: Explore and query data live in the stream across multiple Kafka clusters, natively inside topics
* SQL Processors: Transform, aggregate, filter and join data streams with SQL
* Global Topic Catalog: Search for topics across your whole streaming estate
* Self-Service Data Movement & Connector Deployment: Manage connectors, monitor their health, and manage consumer groups from one place.
